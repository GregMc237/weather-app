The original code supplied for review was intenationally incomplete and/or broken.  The requirement for the code review demonstration was to identify and fix all the issues to a workable standard.
This source code is the result.

With [The Weather App] users can search locations by city name and observe the weather. Includes a 5-6 day weather forecast and a 3 hour interval.
<br />
The app was developed using React.js and material-UI.

## âœ¨ Getting Started

- Make sure you already have `Node.js` and `npm` installed in your system.
- You need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). After creating an account, [grab your key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
- Then, under the `src` directory, go to `api/OpenWeatherService` and replace `WEATHER_API_KEY` with your OpenWeatherMap API Key.
  - **`api/OpenWeatherService.js`**: It contains the code related to the back-end of the application.
