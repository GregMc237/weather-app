The app was developed using React.js and material-UI.

## âœ¨ Getting Started

- Make sure you already have `Node.js` and `npm` installed in your system.
- You need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). After creating an account, [grab your key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
